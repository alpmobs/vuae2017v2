    <p>
      VP Adly is a man of dreams and conviction. He was introduced to QNET by his brother, and his life took a most unexpected turn. Filled with determination to achieve his dreams, success came to him just after a few years. For him, there’s no such thing as ‘secrets to success’. You wlll succeed as long as you’re dedicated to be the best person that you can be.
      <br/><br/>
      A prominent servant-leader to his team, The Pathfinders, VP Adly has built networks in Sudan, UAE, Egypt, North Africa, and West Africa.
      <br/><br/>
      VP Adly was announced as a V Partner during V-Malaysia 2009. His addition to The V’s elite roster of leaders has provided a fresh insight and wisdom to take the organisation to the top.
