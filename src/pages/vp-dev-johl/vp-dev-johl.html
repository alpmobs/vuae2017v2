      <h2>V Partner </h2>
      <h1>Dev Johl</h1>
    </div>
    <p class = "intro">Spending his initial working years working as a F&B Director in a 5-Star Hotel in Singapore, V Partner Dev has truly come a long way from what he used to be. He was signed up by VP Pathman Senathirajah way back in 2000 when he was introduced by AVP Girinder Sharma.
    </p>
    <p>
      When queried on what he considers to be the most challenging moment he has faced before, VP Dev goes to say that the mere sustenance of the network itself poses the most tiring duty. In addition, keeping the momentum up in his teams – especially during sleepy periods- is also a tough hurdle.
      <br/><br/>
      For VP Dev, teamwork plays a very important role in an organization. Success in this business is not possible without a team, that’s why he’s grateful for VP Sathi Senathirajah, AVP Rosli Ismail, VC Devaraj Jeevaratnam, and the rest of the CORE InService members among many others, for serving as his pillars of strength.
      <br/><br/>
      VP Dev deems his announcement as a V Partner as one of his proudest moments thus far, shadowed only by the birth of his two beautiful sons – Karan and Jai. Another achievement of which VP Dev is proud of, is being able to manage V-Con through the support of the InService Brotherhood.

      <br/><br/>
      He explains that the formula which he puts most faith in is Dream + Hardwork = $U¢¢£$$. He also believes that every person must not let ‘rejections’ win over their dreams. Being let down is a part of daily life and letting it control you is the biggest mistake that most people make. We should learn from it and get over it!
      <br/><br/>
      VP Dev counts his amazing parents and two brothers, Roop and Venu, loving wife – Malti Johl and crazy cool kids Karan and Jai as his biggest blessings.
      <br/><br/>
      In the little time that VP Dev is not travelling to spread the success of QNET, he enjoys spending time with his boys and relaxing with loved ones.
      <br/><br/>
      VP Dev draws inspiration form the likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and deems the humility of Sachin Tendulkar exemplary and admirable. He also looks up to V Founder Dato’ Sri Vijay Eswaran as his mentor.
      <br/><br/>
      In the next few years, VP Dev aspires to become a better networker, make his team the best and continue to Touch A Billion Hearts through QNET and The V.
